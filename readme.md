## Window-Eyes Revision History Markdown Files

This github repository is my ongoing work on converting the window-eyes revision history, accessed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20191230165951/http://www.gwmicro.com:80/Window-Eyes/Version_History/), into a more condensed, readable, navigable format, for history retaining sake.

## Building the HTML files
The batch script to build the markdown files is located in the root of this repository. Make sure you have Pandoc installed.
